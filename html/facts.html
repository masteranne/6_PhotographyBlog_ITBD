    <h2>Why People Never Smiled in Old Photos</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;Old photographs were taken with huge large format cameras. Because the technology wasn’t as advanced, an image would take hours to expose correctly.
  <br>&emsp;The subjects didn’t smile because they had to stay still for hours for one photo. Taking a photo often involved the use of a head brace for support. Understandably, smiling for hours was an impossible feat.

    <h2>The Left Side of Our Face Looks Better in Photos</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;Apparently, the left side of our faces looks better in photos than the right side. A study conducted by Kelsey Blackburn and James Schrillo from Wake Forest University confirms this.
  <br>&emsp;Their study shows that the left side of our face exhibits a greater intensity of emotion. Because of this, we perceive it as being more attractive.

    <h2>The Most Viewed Photograph in History</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;This photography fact might not be surprising. The most viewed photograph is the default wallpaper for Windows XP. The image named ‘Bliss”, captured by Charles O’Rear in 1996.
  <br>&emsp;He didn’t make as much money as you would imagine. Microsoft bought the image from stock website Corbis.

    <h2>The Most Popular Subjects for Photography in the 1800s Weren’t Alive</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;A surprising photography fact is that one of the most popular subjects used to be dead bodies. This was a way to record the memory and physical appearance of the deceased family member.

    <h2>The Oldest Surviving Image Is Almost 200 Years Old</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;Not only was it taken almost 200 years ago, but it took 8 hours to capture! The photo was taken by Joseph Niepce and named ‘view from the window’.
  <br>
  <p>&emsp;The scene took place in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. The photo shows the surrounding castle and other buildings.
  <br>&emsp;A projected image from the window hit a sensitized plate, which was then used to place the image on paper. A lot of work went into this photo, and we are lucky it survived.

    <h2>The Daguerreotype Was the First Camera Capable of Recording an Image</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;The daguerreotype was a photographic process created by Louis-Jacques-Mande Daguerre. The entire process from start to finish was very complicated. But without it, we wouldn’t be where we are today. It was the first image capturing device.
  <br>&emsp;A camera made by French manufacturers Susse Freres (Susse Brothers) in 1839 sold in 2007 for almost $800,000.

    <h2>The World’s Most Expensive Photograph Sold for $4.3 Million</h2> 
    <p>&emsp;In 1999, Andreas Gursky captured the world’s most expensive photo, Rhein II. In 2011, 12 years later, it sold for an incredible $4,338,500 at auction.
  <br>&emsp;It is still the most expensive photo. Peter Lik boasts of having sold a picture for over $7 Million, but there is no proof, as the buyer wanted to remain anonymous.
