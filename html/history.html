    <p style="width: 50%">Photography has come a long way in its relatively short history. In almost 200 years, the camera developed from a plain box that took blurry photos to the high-tech mini computers found in today's DSLRs and smartphones.<br>
  The story of photography is fascinating and it's possible to go into great detail. However, let's take a brief look at the highlights and major developments of this scientific art form.</p>

    <h2>The First Cameras</h2>
    <div align="center"><img src="https://omaralnadr.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/8/8/27881113/6700418_orig.jpg"> </div> 
    <p>&emsp;The basic concept of photography has been around since about the 5th century B.C.E. It wasn't until an Iraqi scientist developed something called the camera obscura in the 11th century that the art was born.
<br>
  &emsp;Even then, the camera did not actually record images, it simply projected them onto another surface. The images were also upside down, though they could be traced to create accurate drawings of real objects such as buildings.
<br>
  &emsp;The first camera obscura used a pinhole in a tent to project an image from outside the tent into the darkened area. It was not until the 17th century that the camera obscura became small enough to be portable. Basic lenses to focus the light were also introduced around this time.</p>
  </div>
   <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>The First Permanent Images</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6a8e67f21661d6e0ee0add58e9874922"> </div>
    <p>Photography, as we know it today, began in the late 1830s in France. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce used a portable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This is the first recorded image that did not fade quickly.
<br>

&emsp;Niépce's success led to a number of other experiments and photography progressed very rapidly. Daguerreotypes, emulsion plates, and wet plates were developed almost simultaneously in the mid- to late-1800s.
<br>
&emsp;With each type of emulsion, photographers experimented with different chemicals and techniques. The following are the three that were instrumental in the development of modern photography.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Daguerreotype</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:690x388,c:crop/84/3484-050-A8ABD368/Still-Life-collection-Louis-Jacques-Mande-Daguerre-Societe-Francaise-1837.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;first successful form of photography, named for Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre of France, who invented the technique in collaboration with Nicéphore Niépce in the 1830s. Daguerre and Niépce found that if a copper plate coated with silver iodide was exposed to light in a camera, then fumed with mercury vapour and fixed by a solution of common salt, a permanent image would be formed. A great number of daguerreotypes, especially portraits, were made in the mid-19th century; the technique was supplanted by the wet collodion process.</p>
  </div>
 <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Emulsion Plates</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://yaffa-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/yaffadsp/images/dmImage/StandardImage/liquid-emulsion-capture.jpg" style="width: 300px;"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;Emulsion plates, or wet plates, were less expensive than daguerreotypes and required only two or three seconds of exposure time. This made them much more suited to portrait photographs, which was the most common use of photography at the time. Many photographs from the Civil War were produced on wet plates. <br>

&emsp;These wet plates used an emulsion process called the Collodion process, rather than a simple coating on the image plate. It was during this time that bellows were added to cameras to help with focusing.<br>

&emsp;Two common types of emulsion plates were the ambrotype and the tintype. Ambrotypes used a glass plate instead of the copper plate of the daguerreotypes. Tintypes used a tin plate. While these plates were much more sensitive to light, they had to be developed quickly. Photographers needed to have chemistry on hand and many traveled in wagons that doubled as a darkroom.</p>
  </div>
<div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Dry Plates</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://picturecorrect-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dry-plate-photography-2.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;In the 1870s, photography took another huge leap forward. Richard Maddox improved on a previous invention to make dry gelatine plates that were nearly equal to wet plates in speed and quality.<br>

&emsp;These dry plates could be stored rather than made as needed. This allowed photographers much more freedom in taking photographs. The process also allowed for smaller cameras that could be hand-held. As exposure times decreased, the first camera with a mechanical shutter was developed.
</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>The Horrors of War</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/150220/a_flashback_rosenthal_150220.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;Around 1930, Henri-Cartier Bresson and other photographers began to use small 35mm cameras to capture images of life as it occurred rather than staged portraits. When World War II started in 1939, many photojournalists adopted this style.<br>

&emsp;The posed portraits of World War I soldiers gave way to graphic images of war and its aftermath. Images such as Joel Rosenthal's photograph, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima brought the reality of war home and helped galvanize the American people like never before. This style of capturing decisive moments shaped the face of photography forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>The Wonder of Instant Images</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/thmb/o_FnRdFQbEwO0XXKYOUUy8aCqvg=/1629x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/stack-of-photographs--taken-for-vacation--saipan--78137492-5c2d748046e0fb0001fffffb.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;At the same time that 35mm cameras were becoming popular, Polaroid introduced the Model 95. Model 95 used a secret chemical process to develop film inside the camera in less than a minute. <br>

&emsp;This new camera was fairly expensive but the novelty of instant images caught the public's attention. By the mid-1960s, Polaroid had many models on the market and the price had dropped so that even more people could afford it.<br>

&emsp;In 2008, Polaroid stopped making their famous instant film and took their secrets with them. Many groups such as The Impossible Project and Lomography have tried to revive instant film with limited success. As of 2018, it remains difficult to replicate the quality that was found in a Polaroid.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Advanced Image Control</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/thmb/fcVEONWv_TxPoHK7jy_1rFzSw-Q=/1592x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/young-woman-photographing-outdoors-928696746-5c2d70a146e0fb000169e702.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;While the French introduced the permanent image, the Japanese brought easier image control to the photographer.<br>

&emsp;In the 1950s, Asahi (which later became Pentax) introduced the Asahiflex and Nikon introduced its Nikon F camera. These were both SLR-type cameras and the Nikon F allowed for interchangeable lenses and other accessories.<br>

&emsp;For the next 30 years, SLR-style cameras remained the camera of choice. Many improvements were introduced to both the cameras and the film itself.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>Introducing Smart Cameras</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/thmb/U1o0mjvRPGNYntig4azqUpdqcyU=/1633x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mother-taking-a-picture-of-baby-girl-88551810-5c2d6fdf46e0fb00017f4c1c.jpg"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;In the late 1970s and early 1980s, compact cameras that were capable of making image control decisions on their own were introduced. These "point and shoot" cameras calculated shutter speed, aperture, and focus, leaving photographers free to concentrate on composition.<br>

&emsp;The automatic cameras became immensely popular with casual photographers. Professionals and serious amateurs continued to prefer to make their own adjustments and enjoyed the image control available with SLR cameras.</p>
  </div>
     <div class="body" style="padding: 10px;">
    <h2>The Digital Age</h2> 
    <div align="center"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.AtG2S6wBDXjo_HoiWpIFpAHaE8?pid=ImgDet&rs=1"> </div>
    <p>&emsp;In the 1980s and 1990s, numerous manufacturers worked on cameras that stored images electronically. The first of these were point-and-shoot cameras that used digital media instead of film.<br>

&emsp;By 1991, Kodak had produced the first digital camera that was advanced enough to be used successfully by professionals. Other manufacturers quickly followed and today Canon, Nikon, Pentax, and other manufacturers offer advanced digital SLR (DSLR) cameras. <br>&emsp;Even the most basic point-and-shoot camera now takes higher quality images than Niépce’s pewter plate, and smartphones can easily pull off a high-quality printed photograph.<br></p>
